# PiratePlatformer

Hello! Welcome to my first ever game project, a Pirate Platformer completed exclusively in Java. The goal of this project was to gain familiarity with the fundamentals of how games are constructed, alongside a core gameplay loop. I had lots of fun with this project, and I hope you enjoy it as well!

More documentation is in progress.
